    "In this lesson, we will be analysing a dataset from the World Health Organisation. We will first load the data that we will be using, and then looking through it to understand it. When this is done, we will need to clean it on order to get the parts that are interesting to us, and then we will find some correlations among variable to see how they relate to each other. More specifically, we will be looking at the correlation between GDP and life expectancy.\n",

    "Run the cells with code written on them. To do this, you can select them and press Shift + Enter or press the \"Play\" button on the left side of the cell (if you do not see this, hover with the mouse on the cell and it should appear). Remember that all cells need to be run in order, even those in which you did not need to write any code. If you think you might have skipped one, on the left side of the cell you will find the line number, which corresponds to the order in which you have ran the cells. Keep in mind that if you run a cell and it gets numbered as 4, if you run the same cell immediately after it will be renumbered to 5.\n",
